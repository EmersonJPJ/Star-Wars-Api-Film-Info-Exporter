# Star Wars Film Info Exporter  

## Description  
Star Wars Film Info Exporter is a Java-based backend application that retrieves and processes film data from the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.dev/). This project utilizes a complete suite of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The final output is a well-structured JSON file containing detailed film information.  

## Features  
- Fetches detailed movie data from the SWAPI.  
- Applies all key OOP principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- Outputs data in a clean, readable JSON format.  
- Provides information such as the title, episode number, opening crawl, director, producer, and release date.  

## Example Output  
```json
{
  "title": "Attack of the Clones",
  "episode_id": 2,
  "opening_crawl": "There is unrest in the Galactic\r\nSenate. Several thousand solar\r\nsystems have declared their\r\nintentions to leave the Republic.\r\n\r\nThis separatist movement,\r\nunder the leadership of the\r\nmysterious Count Dooku, has\r\nmade it difficult for the limited\r\nnumber of Jedi Knights to maintain \r\npeace and order in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nSenator Amidala, the former\r\nQueen of Naboo, is returning\r\nto the Galactic Senate to vote\r\non the critical issue of creating\r\nan ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC\r\nto assist the overwhelmed\r\nJedi....",
